\section{Preface}

Every textbook emerges from the author's belief (sometimes hallucination) that something is definitely missing, explained wrong, or does not have enough depth. 
For two decades, our work in industry and education has been parallel, and we have consistently found dissatisfaction with poor design and an urge to explain how it should be done. The explanation part is tricky. Much harder than labeling someone a bad architect. Often, you realize that your counterpart has a different background, a different level of education, a different depth of thinking, and a different understanding of the field. They may also consider you a condescending jerk who wants to show off the title of the position in the code or documentation review. That makes it even harder. 

Lack of literature that systematically and linearly teaches about the thinking proces is considered
